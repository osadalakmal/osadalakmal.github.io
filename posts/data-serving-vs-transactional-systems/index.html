    <h2 id="a-little-bit-about-my-experience-as-a-software-professional">A little bit about my experience as a software professional
</h2><p>I have now been in the industry close to two decades, and in that time I have moved around a fair bit in terms of<br>
technology stack, the type of systems I work with, the industry I work in, amongst other factors. In my first couple of<br>
years, I worked for a small (at the time!) electronics company that mostly dealt with embedded systems. My work was<br>
mostly concerned with the interface between hardware and software. Though I studied electronics in university, I was always<br>
interested in the programmable aspects of the systems. Accordingly, I got my start in software bringing up development<br>
boards, porting Linux to them, and writing device drivers.</p>
<p>After a bit of that, it was time to move to a job where I did get to use C++, but for a completely different purpose. I<br>
was now working on trading systems, order processing systems, and other financial markets-related software. I would move<br>
on within the company a couple of times, working on everything from mobile software to security systems software. Then, through another couple of companies where<br>
again I worked on financial systems and an e-commerce platform, I ended up where I am now‚Äîat the BBC.</p>
<p>The first thing that hit me when I joined was the fact that our tech stack was very different‚ÄîI had never worked in Scala<br>
before. But what hit me even harder: there were no transactions in the system! The system&rsquo;s<br>
primary focus was to serve the data it had in its databases and data stores, but the loading of that data was mostly a batch process.<br>
Even when it wasn‚Äôt, there were no constraints in terms of event ordering. We could afford to serve data a little bit<br>
out of date, given that we eventually caught up in a reasonable time period. This was a completely different way of thinking about<br>
systems for me.</p>
<p>That contrast got me thinking more deeply about what transactional systems really are, and how they shape the way we build software.</p>
<h2 id="the-world-of-transactions">The world of transactions
</h2><p>Transactional systems vary a lot in what they do and how they do it. But by and large, they can be described as systems that process<br>
changes in real-world properties in a consistent, atomic, and durable manner. They are meant to model real-world entities such as<br>
bank accounts, sales, orders, and inventories. As you are modeling these real-world entities, it is essential that your code<br>
reflects the true state of the real-life entity and thus needs to be consistent. In an actual warehouse, the inventory of goods<br>
doesn‚Äôt become zero even just for a second before assuming the same value as before.</p>
<p>In other database parlance, these systems are often backed by OLTP databases. OLTP stands for Online Transaction Processing, and they<br>
are optimized for the type of workloads that transactional systems generate‚Äîas opposed to OLAP databases, which are optimized<br>
for bulk reads and the types of queries that data-serving systems generate.</p>
<p>Most of the trading and financial applications that I have worked on followed a simple formula: process transactions as fast as possible in a serial manner,<br>
and then find an axis along which you can shard the system so that the shards can run in a shared-nothing manner. Then you can just throw more<br>
shards at the problem to scale.</p>
<p>In very low latency systems, multithreading becomes an overhead. You<br>
are much better off focusing on single-threaded performance and optimizing via techniques such as SIMD instructions. But it also means that most of the time you are worrying about write performance and avoiding actual<br>
database writes. You‚Äôll employ everything from in-process caches, out-of-process caches, and write-ahead logs to avoid a<br>
round trip to the database.</p>
<p>You give very little thought to the querying side of the system apart from basic due diligence. But you really don‚Äôt worry about the data model,<br>
because the only way you are going to read the data is the same way you wrote it‚Äîas a transaction.</p>
<p>In contrast, the system I joined at the BBC operated in a fundamentally different way.</p>
<h2 id="my-adventures-on-the-other-side-of-the-fence">My adventures on the other side of the fence
</h2><p>The system that my team currently works on is a data-serving platform. It‚Äôs not exactly an OLAP platform in that we don‚Äôt serve arbitrary queries on the data,<br>
but the ingestion side and serving side are cleanly separated.</p>
<p>The data load happens through an event feed that uses ingestion logic separate from the serving logic. Ingestion can also be triggered in a batch mode to backfill the full data set if needed.</p>
<p>The data-serving side works on a request/response model. It‚Äôs optimized for sustained workloads and is mostly concerned<br>
with query latency. This is a textbook application of the CQRS model: the read and write sides are completely separate.</p>
<p>Performance on the read side is determined mostly by the form of the data in the stores‚ÄîRedis caches or databases. There is very little<br>
processing when serving a request. We mostly just pull the data out, apply a bit of transformation and business logic, and serve it.</p>
<p>And the other surprising part: write performance mattered very little. Because the system lacked real-time consistency needs, we could batch writes.<br>
Even with ingestion delays, we could catch up when update rates dropped. This was a completely different way of thinking about systems for me. Unsettling at first, but I‚Äôve grown comfortable with it.</p>
<p>These systems scale along the axis of read traffic. To scale well, you manage users and data.</p>
<p>The data model should be as close to the query model as possible. The users should be handled as efficiently as possible‚Äîavoid per-connection threading and minimize communication overhead.</p>
<p>Seeing both systems up close helped me crystallize the differences. Here‚Äôs a simplified comparison.</p>

<p>But switching system types wasn‚Äôt just a technical shift‚Äîit challenged how I thought about engineering altogether.</p>
<h2 id="learning-to-think-differently">Learning to think differently
</h2><p>Writing a matching engine or a risk management system, there is rarely a need to model your system beyond a rudimentary way. We would have<br>
well-established patterns and concepts‚Äîorder book, positions, etc.‚Äîthat everyone understood. The domains were predefined,<br>
and user needs were prescriptive.</p>
<p>In adapting to a system where the query model matters, I‚Äôve had to grapple with understanding the business domain. How to model it, speak the language of domain experts,<br>
and translate that into requirements. This requires a mindshift‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôve built your career being the one who knows things.</p>
<p>But once you let go of the fear of needing to learn something new, the path forward becomes clearer.</p>
<p>The most basic thing was talking to people. The team had existed a long time and had built an internal language they all implicitly understood.<br>
But it wasn‚Äôt documented. So I asked questions‚Äîfrequently, but respectfully:</p>
<ol>
<li>I could nod along and ask later, but that meant I‚Äôd only half understand what followed.</li>
<li>Other new joiners would feel encouraged to ask too.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next was widening the circle. The more I explored, the more I realized people didn‚Äôt always know systems in depth‚Äîeven when they spoke confidently. Systems people referred to daily were often not fully understood. I made it a point to talk to folks from across backgrounds and systems to understand the whole ecosystem. Often, they‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúHey, this has been a long-standing problem!‚Äù</p>
<p>Then came understanding common architectural patterns. Whether dealing with out-of-order S3 events or DB query caching with external caches, our org had go-to solutions. Even if a different approach might be incrementally better, sticking to the known pattern made the system easier for others to reason about. If you&rsquo;re not convinced, check out <a class="link" href="https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >enterprise integration pattern</a>.</p>
<p>Still, your core skills remain useful. Understanding RDBMS internals, query optimization, network stacks, OSI layers, caching strategies‚Äîall of that continues to matter. That part never changes.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion
</h2><p>This post started as a way to contrast two very different types of software systems I‚Äôve worked on‚Äîbut along the way, it became something else. It became a reflection on how we grow as engineers when the rules of the game change.</p>
<p>If there‚Äôs a core message here, it‚Äôs this: foundational skills matter. The ability to understand systems, think clearly about trade-offs, and collaborate with others‚Äîthose are the real constants. They carry across domains, stacks, and even job descriptions.</p>
<p>A long time ago, I read a Superman comic that said: ‚ÄúOnce you are Superman, you will always be Superman.‚Äù That stuck with me. Once you‚Äôve built those fundamentals, you can step into almost any system‚Äîand make it better.</p>
