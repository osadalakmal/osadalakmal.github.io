&lt;h2 id=&#34;history-of-serialization-formats&#34;&gt;History of Serialization Formats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serialization formats have a pretty long history dating back to the 1980s when Sun Microsystems introduced XDR (External Data Representation) as part of their Network File System (NFS) protocol. XDR was designed to provide a standard way of encoding data for network transmission, allowing different computer architectures to exchange information seamlessly. This paved the way for more sophisticated serialization formats, including ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) which gained popularity in telecommunications and cryptography, and CORBA&amp;rsquo;s CDR (Common Data Representation) used in distributed object systems. There may have been standardaized formats before XDR but I have neither studied nor known them. But XDR is still alive and can be used today with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/xdr.3.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;libc RPC interfaces&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the internet evolved, new serialization formats emerged to meet changing needs. XML (eXtensible Markup Language) became widely adopted in the late 1990s and early 2000s for its human-readable format and flexibility. However, its verbosity led to the development of more compact alternatives. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) gained traction in the mid-2000s for its simplicity and native support in web browsers. YAML (YAML Ain&amp;rsquo;t Markup Language) also emerged as a human-friendly, easy-to-read format, particularly popular for configuration files. Subsequently, binary formats like Protocol Buffers, MessagePack, and Apache Thrift were developed to offer improved performance and smaller payload sizes, catering to the growing demands of high-speed, large-scale data exchange in modern distributed systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-xml-for-everything-to-xml-is-bad-for-everyone&#34;&gt;From XML for Everything to XML is bad for Everyone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 2000s you could not escape XML even if you wanted to. It was state of the art and it was everywhere. We were going to use it for communication. And with DTDs or Xml Schema Documents we were going to use it to validate communications. We were going to use it to sepcifiy the styling and formatting using XSLT. We were going to use XPath to specify subsets of XML documents as part of the XSLT standard and we were going to use XQuery to query XML files allowing us to build a document database around XML documents. Java beans were using it to specify &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://xmlbeans.apache.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;everything&lt;/a&gt;. And we were creating communication protocols based on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;XML as a standard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you would inevitably expect it to, this attitude of let&amp;rsquo;s use XML for everything led to an industry backslash. This coincided with the rise of a new cohort of web based startups that were starting to grow in popularity and had to face scaling issues due to growth that was unheard of before that. Around this time &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;REST&lt;/a&gt; starts making an appearance in the industry and is gaining ground in engineer mindspace. Compared to SOAP, the new technology is very easy to grok and much easier to setup. It uses HTTP verbs for the CRUD operations and can be used even with simple tools like curl. There is no need to use complex tooling that could generate and digest XML as before with SOAP. And along with this drop in usage of SOAP, comes the decline in usage of XML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In to this mix comes JSON, first invented by Douglas Crockford around 2000/2001, this was a subset of Javascript when it was first created. It was simpler to understand and write than comparable XML and most certainly less verbose. This meant that it was the perfect accompaniment for REST to use as a serialization format although nothing dicatated that it must be JSON. So most of the web companies (SaaS, Social Media, etc) started using the REST + JSON as the default communications framework. And to throw another complication in to the midst of all this, the microservice revolution took off around the same time as well. From monoliths to Service Oriented Architecture to microservices, this meant that it was time to churn out more and more microservices that had drastically simpler interfaces. Due to the published best practice from around the time being that a given microservice would do one thing and one thing only, we started creating simpler services by the dozen. And this meant we needed to make the interfaces as simple as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that in a nutshell is how we went from SOAP + XML to REST + JSON in a few years. I watched in fascination and the titans in the industry debated and quarraled over all this since I was just a junior engineer with no real idea about the tradeoffs involved. All this was jargon wars for me. And now a decade on, I relaize that some profound changes happened during that era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fast-paced world of business and decision-making, ensuring that everyone is on the same page and in agreement is essential. A crucial aspect of effective decision-making is building consensus before a meeting takes place. Consensus-building allows teams to align their thoughts, opinions, and goals, leading to more productive meetings and better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Japanese culture, there is a term that encapsulates this process beautifully - &amp;ldquo;nemawashi.&amp;rdquo; Nemawashi refers to the practice of laying the groundwork and seeking agreement among stakeholders before a meeting or decision-making process begins. It is a fundamental concept that plays a significant role in achieving harmony and collaboration within organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we will delve into the concept of nemawashi and explore its practical implications for building consensus before meetings. We will discuss the cultural significance of nemawashi in Japan and its relevance in a broader context. Furthermore, we will outline effective strategies that can help you incorporate nemawashi techniques to foster collaboration, engagement, and successful decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we try to understand the art of building consensus and discover how nemawashi can transform your meetings into more fruitful and harmonious experiences. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore the power of nemawashi and its impact on achieving alignment within your team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-nemawashi&#34;&gt;Understanding Nemawashi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nemawashi, rooted in Japanese culture, holds valuable lessons for building consensus before meetings. By embracing this practice, teams can set the stage for productive discussions and decision-making. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore the meaning and significance of nemawashi, along with some practical examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, nemawashi involves laying the groundwork and seeking agreement among stakeholders before a meeting or decision-making process begins. This process allows individuals to voice their opinions, address concerns, and find common ground, leading to smoother decision-making and improved outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-1-toyotas-decision-making-process&#34;&gt;Example 1: Toyota&amp;rsquo;s Decision-Making Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most famous examples of nemawashi can be found in the decision-making process at Toyota, a renowned Japanese automobile manufacturer. Before any major decision is made, Toyota follows a meticulous approach that involves extensive consultation and consensus-building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams engage in cross-functional meetings, where representatives from various departments share their perspectives, concerns, and ideas. This process allows for a comprehensive understanding of the issue at hand and helps identify potential obstacles or risks. By incorporating nemawashi, Toyota ensures that decisions are made collaboratively, taking into account the viewpoints of all relevant stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-2-us-government-and-legislative-process&#34;&gt;Example 2: U.S. Government and Legislative Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While nemawashi is rooted in Japanese culture, similar principles of consensus-building can be observed in the U.S. government&amp;rsquo;s legislative process. Before bills are brought to the floor for a vote, extensive negotiations, discussions, and consensus-building efforts take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S. Congress, lawmakers engage in committee meetings, hearings, and informal conversations to gather input from various stakeholders. This process allows representatives to address concerns, incorporate amendments, and build consensus among different factions. Through these deliberations, consensus is sought to increase the chances of a bill&amp;rsquo;s successful passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of how the U.S. legislative process and consensus-building are depicted is the television show &amp;ldquo;The West Wing.&amp;rdquo; The show portrays the inner workings of the White House and provides insights into the intricate process of developing and passing legislation. It showcases the efforts of policymakers to build consensus, negotiate, and seek agreement among different parties to advance their policy agendas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &amp;ldquo;The West Wing&amp;rdquo; is a fictional representation, it offers viewers a glimpse into the complexities and nuances of consensus-building in the U.S. political landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By highlighting this example, we can observe that nemawashi-inspired practices and consensus-building efforts exist beyond cultural boundaries. Consensus-building is a universal concept that plays a crucial role in effective decision-making across diverse settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strategies-for-building-consensus&#34;&gt;Strategies for Building Consensus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building consensus before a meeting requires careful planning, effective communication, and fostering a collaborative environment. By employing the following strategies, you can create a foundation for productive discussions and decision-making:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparing for the Meeting - Thorough preparation is essential for successful consensus-building. Consider the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather Information: Seek input from stakeholders and team members before the meeting. Collect diverse perspectives and insights to gain a comprehensive understanding of the topic at hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Address Concerns: Take the time to identify and address any potential concerns or objections that participants may have. Addressing these early on can help mitigate resistance and pave the way for consensus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One-on-One Meetings: Engage in individual discussions with key stakeholders to understand their viewpoints and gather feedback. This personal touch allows for open and honest conversations, fostering a sense of inclusion and trust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invite Contributions: Show respect for stakeholders by genuinely considering their perspectives and inviting their contributions. Recognize that they may bring valuable insights and solutions to the table. This approach promotes collaboration and a sense of ownership among participants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective Communication Techniques - Clear and open communication is vital for building consensus. Consider these techniques:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Active Listening: Practice attentive and empathetic listening. Encourage participants to express their thoughts, concerns, and ideas, and ensure that everyone feels heard and respected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facilitate Constructive Discussions: Create an inclusive environment where diverse perspectives are encouraged. Set ground rules for respectful dialogue and constructive debate. Guide the conversation towards finding common ground and shared goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual Aids and Examples: Utilize visual aids, data, and real-life examples to illustrate your points and foster a shared understanding. Visual representations can bridge gaps in perception and facilitate consensus-building.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building Trust and Collaboration - Trust and collaboration are key elements of consensus-building. Consider the following approaches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourage Collaboration: Foster a culture of collaboration by promoting teamwork and emphasizing collective goals. Encourage participants to work together, share ideas, and find mutually beneficial solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transparency and Accountability: Promote transparency in decision-making processes. Clearly communicate the rationale behind decisions and ensure accountability for actions. This builds trust and confidence among team members.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inclusive Decision-Making: Involve all relevant stakeholders in the decision-making process. Seek diverse perspectives and involve those who may be affected by the outcome. This inclusive approach increases ownership and commitment to the decisions made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By incorporating these strategies into your consensus-building efforts, you can lay a solid foundation for successful meetings. Remember to appear open to problem discussions rather than solely focusing on solutions and demonstrate respect for stakeholders by inviting their contributions. Consensus-building requires active engagement and continuous effort to create an environment where diverse voices are valued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up we should discuss the effective ways of communication in order to execute above strategies. And discuss why trust is pramount to executing these strategies. Expect that in the next installment of this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
