<p>I first heard of cloud9 before it was acquired by AWS in 2016. In those days it was a novelty. But the good sort - the sort of thing you think of and say &ldquo;Man, if only I had that sort of flexibility&rdquo;. This was before Google docs was a widespread thing and collaborating on a cloud IDE that existed independently of your computer was unheard of. Everytime I wanted to send some code snippet to a coworker and they needed more context, I would think to myself, there has to be a better way to do this.</p>
<p>Cloud9 was originally founded in 2010 and created the open source product. This was then acquired by Amazon and turned in to their own offering of a cloud IDE running on EC2.</p>
